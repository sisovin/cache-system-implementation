- **Programming Languages**: Go, Rust, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Messaging System**: Kafka
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Apache JMeter, Locust

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Client-Side Caching

  2. Perform dynamic content requests under load and verify that responses are served from the Cache API.
  3. Store and retrieve data in localStorage and sessionStorage under load and verify that it works correctly.
  4. Invalidate cached data under load and verify that the cache is updated accordingly.

### 2. Load Balancer & CDN
- **Objective**: Ensure that the load balancer and CDN caching mechanisms can handle high traffic.

  2. Verify that cached responses are served from Redis under load.
  3. Perform health checks on cache nodes under load and verify that they are functioning correctly.
  4. Test TLS termination under load and verify that cache-friendly headers are set.
  5. Purge the CDN cache under load and verify that the cache is updated.

### 3. API Gateway
- **Objective**: Validate the caching mechanisms in the API Gateway under high traffic.
- **Components**: FastAPI, Go middleware, hierarchical cache, rate limiting, GraphQL
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to the API Gateway and verify that requests are served from the hierarchical cache.
  2. Perform requests under load and verify that rate limiting is enforced.
  3. Test GraphQL queries under load and verify that responses are served from the cache.
  4. Generate cache keys under load and verify that they are unique for different requests.

### 4. Distributed Cache
- **Objective**: Ensure that the distributed cache can handle high traffic.
- **Components**: Hazelcast, Redis cluster, cache-aside, write-through, replication
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to the Hazelcast and Redis clusters and verify that they are functioning correctly.
  2. Perform cache-aside operations under load and verify that data is loaded into the cache.
  3. Perform write-through operations under load and verify that data is written to both the cache and the database.
  4. Test cache replication under load and verify that data is replicated across nodes.
  5. Monitor the cache under load and verify that metrics are collected.

### 5. Messaging
- **Objective**: Validate the messaging mechanisms for cache updates and population under high traffic.
- **Components**: Kafka producer, consumer group, dead-letter queue, message TTL, cache warm-up
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to the Kafka producer and verify that cache update messages are sent.
  2. Simulate high traffic to the consumer group and verify that cache update messages are consumed.
  3. Test the dead-letter queue under load and verify that failed messages are handled correctly.
  4. Set message TTL under load and verify that transient data is removed after the specified time.
  5. Perform cache warm-up under load using the message log and verify that the cache is populated.

### 6. Full-Text Search
- **Objective**: Ensure that the full-text search caching mechanisms can handle high traffic.
- **Components**: Elasticsearch, index caching, query result cache, fielddata cache, shard query cache
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to Elasticsearch and verify that index caching is functioning correctly.
  2. Perform queries under load and verify that results are served from the query result cache.
  3. Set fielddata cache limits under load and verify that they are enforced.
  4. Test shard query cache under load and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  5. Perform search-as-you-type queries under load and verify that results are served from the cache.

### 7. Relational Database
- **Objective**: Validate the caching mechanisms in the relational database under high traffic.
- **Components**: PostgreSQL, shared_buffers, WAL archiving, materialized view, connection pooling, cache invalidation
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to PostgreSQL and verify that shared_buffers tuning improves performance.
  2. Configure WAL archiving under load and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  3. Refresh materialized views under load and verify that they are updated correctly.
  4. Set up connection pooling under load and verify that it improves performance.
  5. Create cache invalidation triggers under load and verify that they work as expected.

### 8. Common Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Ensure that the common infrastructure components can handle high traffic.
- **Components**: Distributed tracing, cache metrics, multi-level invalidation, cache encryption, chaos testing
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up distributed tracing under load and verify that cache operations are traced.
  2. Implement cache metrics under load and verify that hit/miss ratios are collected.
  3. Perform multi-level cache invalidation under load and verify that it works as expected.
  4. Configure cache encryption under load and verify that data is encrypted at rest.
  5. Perform chaos testing under load and verify that the cache system is resilient to failures.

### 9. Deployment
- **Objective**: Validate the deployment process for the cache system under high traffic.
- **Components**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, blue-green deployment, cache migration
- **Steps**:
  1. Dockerize all components and verify that they can be built and run correctly under load.
  2. Deploy the cache system to Kubernetes and verify that it is functioning correctly under load.
  3. Set up Terraform for cache infrastructure and verify that it works as expected under load.
  4. Perform blue-green deployment under load and verify that the cache system is updated without downtime.
  5. Execute cache migration scripts under load and verify that data is migrated correctly.
