# Chaos Engineering Checklist for Cache System

## Overview
This checklist outlines the steps and considerations for performing chaos engineering tests on the cache system. The goal is to identify weaknesses and improve the resilience of the cache system under various failure scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that the cache system is deployed and running in a test environment.
- Set up monitoring and logging to capture metrics and logs during chaos tests.
- Define the scope and objectives of the chaos tests.

## Chaos Engineering Steps

### 1. Identify Critical Components
- List all critical components of the cache system (e.g., Redis, Hazelcast, API Gateway).
- Identify dependencies and interactions between components.

### 2. Define Failure Scenarios
- Network latency and partitioning
- Cache node failures
- Data corruption
- High traffic spikes
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)

### 3. Prepare Test Environment
- Create a test environment that mirrors the production setup.
- Ensure that the test environment is isolated from production.

### 4. Inject Failures
- Use chaos engineering tools (e.g., Chaos Monkey, Gremlin) to inject failures.
- Simulate network latency and partitioning.
- Terminate cache nodes and observe the impact.
- Introduce data corruption and verify data integrity.
- Generate high traffic spikes and monitor performance.
- Exhaust system resources and observe behavior.

### 5. Monitor and Analyze
- Collect metrics and logs during chaos tests.
- Analyze the impact of failures on the cache system.
- Identify any weaknesses or bottlenecks.

### 6. Implement Improvements
- Based on the analysis, implement improvements to enhance resilience.
- Update configurations, add redundancy, and optimize performance.
- Document the changes and update the chaos engineering plan.

### 7. Repeat and Iterate
- Continuously perform chaos engineering tests to ensure ongoing resilience.
- Regularly update the chaos engineering plan based on new findings and improvements.

## Conclusion
By following this checklist, you can systematically perform chaos engineering tests on the cache system and improve its resilience to various failure scenarios. Regular chaos testing helps ensure that the cache system can handle unexpected failures and maintain performance and reliability.
