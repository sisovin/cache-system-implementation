# Integration Test Plan for Cache System

## Overview
This document outlines the integration test plan for the cache system implementation. The goal of these tests is to ensure that all components of the cache system work together seamlessly and meet the specified requirements.

## Test Environment
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
- **Programming Languages**: Go, Rust, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Messaging System**: Kafka
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Client-Side Caching
- **Objective**: Verify that the client-side caching mechanisms work as expected.
- **Components**: Service Worker, Cache API, localStorage, sessionStorage
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the client application and verify that static assets are cached using the Service Worker.
  2. Perform dynamic content requests and verify that responses are cached using the Cache API.
  3. Store data in localStorage and sessionStorage and verify that it can be retrieved correctly.
  4. Invalidate cached data and verify that the cache is updated accordingly.

### 2. Load Balancer & CDN
- **Objective**: Ensure that the load balancer and CDN caching mechanisms are functioning correctly.
- **Components**: Go HTTP server, Redis, LRU cache, CDN integration
- **Steps**:
  1. Start the Go HTTP server and verify that requests are cached in the LRU cache.
  2. Verify that cached responses are served from Redis.
  3. Perform health checks on cache nodes and verify that they are functioning correctly.
  4. Test TLS termination and verify that cache-friendly headers are set.
  5. Purge the CDN cache and verify that the cache is updated.

### 3. API Gateway
- **Objective**: Validate the caching mechanisms in the API Gateway.
- **Components**: FastAPI, Go middleware, hierarchical cache, rate limiting, GraphQL
- **Steps**:
  1. Start the API Gateway and verify that requests are cached using the hierarchical cache.
  2. Perform requests and verify that rate limiting is enforced.
  3. Test GraphQL queries and verify that responses are cached.
  4. Generate cache keys and verify that they are unique for different requests.

### 4. Distributed Cache
- **Objective**: Ensure that the distributed cache is configured and functioning correctly.
- **Components**: Hazelcast, Redis cluster, cache-aside, write-through, replication
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure the Hazelcast and Redis clusters and verify that they are functioning correctly.
  2. Perform cache-aside operations and verify that data is loaded into the cache.
  3. Perform write-through operations and verify that data is written to both the cache and the database.
  4. Test cache replication and verify that data is replicated across nodes.
  5. Monitor the cache and verify that metrics are collected.

### 5. Messaging
- **Objective**: Validate the messaging mechanisms for cache updates and population.
- **Components**: Kafka producer, consumer group, dead-letter queue, message TTL, cache warm-up
- **Steps**:
  1. Start the Kafka producer and verify that cache update messages are sent.
  2. Start the consumer group and verify that cache update messages are consumed.
  3. Test the dead-letter queue and verify that failed messages are handled correctly.
  4. Set message TTL and verify that transient data is removed after the specified time.
  5. Perform cache warm-up using the message log and verify that the cache is populated.

### 6. Full-Text Search
- **Objective**: Ensure that the full-text search caching mechanisms are functioning correctly.
- **Components**: Elasticsearch, index caching, query result cache, fielddata cache, shard query cache
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure Elasticsearch index caching and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  2. Perform queries and verify that results are cached.
  3. Set fielddata cache limits and verify that they are enforced.
  4. Test shard query cache and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  5. Perform search-as-you-type queries and verify that results are cached.

### 7. Relational Database
- **Objective**: Validate the caching mechanisms in the relational database.
- **Components**: PostgreSQL, shared_buffers, WAL archiving, materialized view, connection pooling, cache invalidation
- **Steps**:
  1. Tune PostgreSQL shared_buffers and verify that it improves performance.
  2. Configure WAL archiving and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  3. Refresh materialized views and verify that they are updated correctly.
  4. Set up connection pooling and verify that it improves performance.
  5. Create cache invalidation triggers and verify that they work as expected.

### 8. Common Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Ensure that the common infrastructure components are functioning correctly.
- **Components**: Distributed tracing, cache metrics, multi-level invalidation, cache encryption, chaos testing
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up distributed tracing and verify that cache operations are traced.
  2. Implement cache metrics and verify that hit/miss ratios are collected.
  3. Perform multi-level cache invalidation and verify that it works as expected.
  4. Configure cache encryption and verify that data is encrypted at rest.
  5. Perform chaos testing and verify that the cache system is resilient to failures.

### 9. Deployment
- **Objective**: Validate the deployment process for the cache system.
- **Components**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, blue-green deployment, cache migration
- **Steps**:
  1. Dockerize all components and verify that they can be built and run correctly.
  2. Deploy the cache system to Kubernetes and verify that it is functioning correctly.
  3. Set up Terraform for cache infrastructure and verify that it works as expected.
  4. Perform blue-green deployment and verify that the cache system is updated without downtime.
  5. Execute cache migration scripts and verify that data is migrated correctly.

## Test Execution
- **Testers**: QA team
- **Test Schedule**: Weekly
- **Test Reporting**: Test results will be documented and shared with the development team.

## Conclusion
This integration test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the cache system implementation. By following this plan, we can ensure that all components work together seamlessly and meet the specified requirements.
