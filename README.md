# Cache System Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a robust and scalable cache system. The project is structured into various components, each addressing specific caching needs across different layers of the technology stack. The goal is to improve performance, scalability, and reliability by leveraging caching techniques.

## Features
- 🌐 **Client-Side Caching**: Offline storage and dynamic content caching for JavaScript/TypeScript applications.
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer & CDN**: Efficient caching for hot routes and CDN integration.
- 🚪 **API Gateway**: Request and response caching with hierarchical strategies and rate-limiting.
- 🧠 **Distributed Cache**: Clustered caching with advanced patterns like cache-aside and write-through.
- ✉️ **Messaging**: Kafka-based cache update and population mechanisms.
- 🔍 **Full-Text Search**: Elasticsearch query and fielddata caching.
- 🗄️ **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL caching and materialized view optimizations.
- 🛠️ **Common Infrastructure**: Cache metrics, encryption, and multi-level invalidation.
