# Cache System Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a robust and scalable cache system. The project is structured into various components, each addressing specific caching needs across different layers of the technology stack. The goal is to improve performance, scalability, and reliability by leveraging caching techniques.

## Features
- 🌐 **Client-Side Caching**: Offline storage and dynamic content caching for JavaScript/TypeScript applications.
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer & CDN**: Efficient caching for hot routes and CDN integration.
- 🚪 **API Gateway**: Request and response caching with hierarchical strategies and rate-limiting.
- 🧠 **Distributed Cache**: Clustered caching with advanced patterns like cache-aside and write-through.
- ✉️ **Messaging**: Kafka-based cache update and population mechanisms.
- 🔍 **Full-Text Search**: Elasticsearch query and fielddata caching.
- 🗄️ **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL caching and materialized view optimizations.
- 🛠️ **Common Infrastructure**: Cache metrics, encryption, and multi-level invalidation.

## Cache Strategies
### Cache-Aside
In the cache-aside strategy, the application code is responsible for loading data into the cache. When the application needs to read data, it first checks the cache. If the data is not found in the cache (a cache miss), the application loads the data from the database and then stores it in the cache for future requests.

### Write-Through
In the write-through strategy, data is written to the cache and the database simultaneously. This ensures that the cache is always up-to-date with the latest data. Write-through caching can help reduce the load on the database by serving read requests directly from the cache.

### Write-Behind
In the write-behind strategy, data is first written to the cache and then asynchronously written to the database. This can improve write performance by allowing the application to continue processing without waiting for the database write to complete. However, it introduces a risk of data loss if the cache is not properly synchronized with the database.

### Read-Through
In the read-through strategy, the cache is responsible for loading data from the database when a cache miss occurs. The application interacts with the cache, and the cache transparently handles loading data from the database as needed. This can simplify application code by centralizing cache management.

### Cache Invalidation
Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating stale data in the cache. There are several strategies for cache invalidation, including time-based expiration, event-based invalidation, and manual invalidation. Proper cache invalidation is crucial to ensure data consistency between the cache and the underlying data store.
